# Gender Data Financing

## Global gender data financing figures

Global funding for gender data has decreased sharply, putting women and girls at particular risk of being left behind without high-quality data. Though overall funding for gender equality increased in 2020, funding for gender data dropped by more than 50% from 2019. This is inconsistent with global ambitions to support gender equality. This worrying trend is consistent with the broader trend in gender equality, where progress has not only stalled but reversed in some cases. Without a gendered approach to data production and use, there will be a lack of insights needed to evaluate how various policies affect women and girls and then take appropriate steps to achieve gender equality.

In the SDG era, five donors have provided two-thirds of funding for gender data, a much higher share than was provided by the top five donors for overall data and statistics (55%). The lack of diversity in the pool of donors makes the stability of funding for gender data more vulnerable to strategic shifts by a single provider, especially during periods of uncertainty.

## Norway’s current gender data and equality strategies 

Global funding flows for gender data activities have not been mainstreamed into the growing support for gender equality. Lack of mainstreaming of support to data and statistics beyond specific support for sectoral data is a key challenge to increasing the effectiveness of support to statistical systems. Exploring the data needs of Norway’s current gender equality program and its future ambitions may be a useful starting point for the development of the forthcoming data strategy.

On the gender data side, Norway is the 9th bilateral provider to gender data with limited . Their top recipients of country-specific aid for gender statistics are Malawi and Ethiopia while funding to other countries are channeled through regional projects. Over the period 2018-2020, Norway had two gender data projects: one for about USD 250 thousand in Malawi for digital birth registration and one for USD 1.7 million as a regional project for Cote d'Ivoire, Mozambique, and Nigeria for "Strengthening Birth Registration Systems to Protect Every Child from Child Labour". Over the past ten years (2011-2020), there have been 7 gender data projects total from Norway, three of which are Malawi.

On the gender equality side, in 2020, Norway committed 46.9% of its screened bilateral allocable aid to gender equality and women’s empowerment, as either a principal or significant objective (up from 39.7% in 2019), compared with the 2020 DAC country average of 44.6%. This is equal to USD 1.6 billion of bilateral ODA in support of gender equality. The share of screened bilateral allocable aid committed to gender equality and women’s empowerment as a principal objective was 8.8%, compared with the 2020 DAC country average of 4.8%. Interventions in economic infrastructure and production sectors focus less on gender than other sectors. Education and population and reproductive health sectors have the strongest focus on gender equality.

An example of including gender data in broader programs on gender equality is mentioned in [Norway’s 2021 Data for Development Profile](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/8cacddb1-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/8cacddb1-en). In 2018 and 2019, Statistics Norway partnered with the Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth, and Family Affairs and is initiating collaboration with Ethiopian and Nepalese sister organisations in the context of Norway’s Gender Equality for Development programme. While the aim of this program was to build technical capacity to strengthen women’s rights and gender equality, the first program phase initially focused on knowledge management and particularly on statistics. Norway may consider lessons learned from this program as it explores future gender equality/gender statistics strategies.
